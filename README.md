# User Story: Task Management Application <a id="user-story"></a>

As a user, I want to be able to effectively manage my tasks. This includes the ability to:

*   **Create new tasks:** I should be able to add new tasks with details like a title, a description, and a due date.
*   **View my tasks:** I should be able to see a list of all my tasks.
*   **Update existing tasks:** I should be able to modify the details of my tasks, including the title, description, due date, and status (e.g., pending, in progress, completed).
*   **Delete tasks:** I should be able to remove tasks that are no longer relevant.
*   **User authentication:** I need to be able to log in with a username and password to access my tasks, ensuring my tasks are private and associated with my account.
*   **Categorize Tasks:** I want to be able to categorize my tasks to better manage them.

The system should provide a clear, intuitive user experience for all of these operations.
